Script created by Salvador Camacho

This script was created with best practices, so it is more resilient, such as:
* Transaction naming
* No add cookies
* No third party
* One validation per transaction
* Think times at the end of each transaction to better simulate user behavior
* Main URL parametrized, Public AOS by default, credentials parametrized

This script sign ins, then randomly selects a product from the category and purchases it

Runtime Settings were set to log only on errors and generate snapshot on errors, think times 75% to 150%
